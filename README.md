# My Ansible Collections
These Ansible collections live under the [pcolladosoto](https://galaxy.ansible.com/ui/namespaces/pcolladosoto/)
namespace on [Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com).

They can all be installed with:

    ansible-galaxy collection install pcolladosoto.<collection-name>

Hope they prove useful!
