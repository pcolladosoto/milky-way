# UAM's LHC Tier-2 Collection

This Ansible collection contains several Ansible goodies we use to run and manage
our Tier-2 installation for CERN's ATLAS experiment on a daily basis.

You can take a look at the documentation on [Ansible Galaxy](https://galaxy.ansible.com/ui/repo/published/pcolladosoto/grid/).
